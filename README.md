## Additional Notes

* This theme is intended purely for demonstrating the Settings API and related functions. This should not be used as a foundation for other work or as a theme for blogging, content management, etc.
* Feel free to submit any pull requests, though I'll likely decline them - this theme is closely aligned with content in [this series](http://wp.tutsplus.com/series/the-complete-guide-to-the-wordpress-settings-api/) and is likely written as-is for a specific reason.
